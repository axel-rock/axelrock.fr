You might know TED. This is an incredible source of interesting point of view. I'm more and more interested in education, and how we could make it better. Talks from Sir Ken Robinson and Logan Laplante are very inspiring. First of all, they are both great speakers, whether they are 13 or over 50 years old. Every time watch these, I keep smiling the all time. Above all, they give us keys to hack things that truly matters.
