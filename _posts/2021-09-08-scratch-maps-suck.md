I know I’m gonna offend several of my friends. I don’t blame you, scratch maps are fun and good looking. 

But they are flawed.

Going once to a country almost never means being done with it. 

Think about your country. In my case, France. I’ve spent 28 of my 30 years living here, and there are still dozens of places, hundreds maybe, that are worth visiting, and that doesn’t even count for experiences and culture. 

I’ve been to Japan twice, Finland 3 times, and even more in Norway, but these are still the top 3 countries I want to travel to. 

There is no way they I’m gonna mark them as done anytime soon. 

Scratch maps don’t suck, but the fact of considering a country as “done” is just something I think about when I see these.
