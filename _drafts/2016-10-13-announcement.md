La lettre que j'ai envoyé à mes collègues pour leur annoncer mon départ.

___

> Bannergirlz, Bannerboyz,

> There is a piece of news I want to share with you.

> I’m going to leave Bannerboy—**BUT WAIT!**—Let me explain.

> Some of you already know, but I’d like to explain it.

> (Go grab a coffee if you plan to read it)

___

> When I moved to Stockholm about a year and half ago, I didn’t expect to enjoy it that much. I fell in love with the city, but also with the company.

> I love the office, the work I have to do, the level of expectation from our client, you guys, the amount of stuff I learn, that you trust me and my skills, how well our producers take care of us, that we are the best at what we do, the work-life balance, the interesting talks, speaking English, hearing Swedish (and Finnish, Dutch, German, Chinese, Norwegian?, you speaking French) … I love a shit ton of stuff.

> But if I leave, it’s mostly for something way more important to me: friends and family.

___

> Do you think I’ll find a company in France to bring me all that?

> I don’t!

> So, I decided to create my own. And I hope that one day it’ll become something as cool as Bannerboy.

> I don’t want to compete with Bannerboy. And although I love doing banners, there are other things I’d like to work with (like making websites, working with user experience and creating content).

> When I told all that to Erik, we agreed that we should try to continue working together, in a way or another.

___

> So, I will leave the office at the end of November, and start working as a freelance. Part for/with Bannerboy, part for my other website-projects.

> If that works well for both sides within the next few months, I will create a company in France, probably called CAYU*, which could be part of the Bannerboy Family®.

> I will work my *** off to make this happen, and turn it into a win-win situation.

___

> Before I let you go back to work, just know that during the couple of weeks I have left:

> - I’ll try to write documentation or comment all the internal tools I’ve worked with here (the wall, the wheel, the blog…). But if you’re interested in knowing more about of them, let me know and we’ll try to find time for quick introduction.
> - Until my last day here, and even after that, it will ALWAYS be a pleasure to help you with anything. That never bothers me. I truly enjoy it, and I don’t see it as duty related to my job. So feel free to ask.
And here is a gif to apologise for such a serious email.

> Thanks for reading. Have a great day!

Et merci à mes collègues pour les merveilleuses réponses que j'ai eu en retour.
